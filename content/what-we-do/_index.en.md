  description: >-
    DIVD scans the whole internet on the presence of Common Vulnerabilities and
    Exposures (CVEs) as soon as they are published and have a high score. When
    we find vulnerable URLs, we send them an email with notification on the
    vulnerability present, where we found it and what to do. 


    We also find new vulnerabilities (zero-days) and share these with the software vendor, so they can fix it. Furthermore, when we detect instances of compromised credentials, we take swift action by alerting affected individuals via email and urging them to immediately change their passwords.
