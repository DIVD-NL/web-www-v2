  description: >-
    DIVD scans the whole internet on the presence of Common Vulnerabilities and
    Exposures (CVEs) as soon as they are published and have a high score. When
    we find vulnerable URLs, we send them an email with notification on the
    vulnerability present, where we found it and what to do. 


    We also find new vulnerabilities (zero-days) and share these with the software vendor, so they can fix it. Furthermore, when we detect instances of compromised credentials, we take swift action by alerting affected individuals via email and urging them to immediately change their passwords. 
scouting:
  title: "Scan the internet for vulnerabilities "
  description: "When our CSIRT team founds or knows about a vulnerability, they
    scan the internet and identify the affected systems. By developing a scan
    method (per case), we do this in the least impactful way possible. "
assessing:
  description: After affected systems are identified we investigate to who these
    systems belong to and send them a notification. This notification informs
    them of the vulnerability and offers steps to fix or mitigate it. Our
    research methodes always comply with our code of conduct.
