On 3 June, we sent a letter from the DIVD Academy to outgoing minister MariÃ«lle Paul about the SBB's planned withdrawal of our recognition from 1 July 2024. This decision will have major consequences for VMBO, MBO, LWT students and students with disabilities, who are already struggling to find internships. The DIVD Academy selflessly offers these young people a platform to increase their knowledge and skills and develop into responsible citizens. Withdrawing our recognition is heartless and socially unwise. We urge the minister to suspend this withdrawal so that our students can complete their planned placements. Please support us and help these young people find a promising future! [Click here!](https://petities.nl/petitions/behoud-de-erkenning-van-divd-academy-voor-kwetsbare-studenten?locale=nl)
