Last year, Operation Endgame marked the biggest anti-botnet operation to date. The The Dutch Police, in cooperation with policy units form Germany, France, Denmark, the United States and United Kingdom and suppor to Europol and Eurojust had infiltrated a number of botnets. Now, they are back. Operation Endgame 2.0 marks new takedowns and new information obtained by the organizations behind this operation.
