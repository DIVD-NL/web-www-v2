We identified a recurring security issue across multiple Mendix applications where data sources (entities/tables) are **accessible to anonymous users or to newly registered users** with overly broad permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information **without** exploiting a software vulnerability in the Mendix platform itself.

The issue is primarily caused by **application-level authorization misconfiguration**, such as:

- entity access rules that are too permissive
- incorrect role mappings
- missing or overly broad XPath constraints
- overly permissive rights for the Anonymous user or default/newly registered users

This is a known pattern frequently observed during pentests of Mendix applications, and has now been validated at larger scale across many organisations.

## Affected scope

This is **not limited to a specific Mendix version or a single produc**t. The scope includes:

- Mendix Cloud hosted applications (potentially thousands of instances)
- on-premise Mendix installations
- internet-facing portals built on Mendix

Because this is an implementation/configuration issue, it can occur in **any Mendix application** where authorization is not correctly designed and enforced.

## How attackers can misuse this

No exploit is needed. Anonymous access or a basic account can be enough to pull data via normal Mendix runtime requests (e.g., /xas), making abuse hard to detect and scalable across many misconfigured apps.

We observed exposed sensitive data (names, contact/address details, customer/internal records, sometimes documents/ID images), leading to GDPR/AVG risk, fraud, phishing, reputational damage, and possible breach notification. Root cause is typically overly permissive app-level authorization (entity access, roles, XPath constraints, microflows), not a Mendix platform vulnerability.

The Mendix client (browser/app) should be considered untrusted; if runtime permissions are too broad, data can be retrieved via normal requests.

## What you can do

Organizations are strongly advised to review Mendix application authorization configurations.

##### Minimum checks:

1. Review **entity access rules** for all entities
2. Review **module role mapping** and **user role assignments**
3. Validate \*\*XPath constraints \*\*and data visibility rules
4. Review permissions of the **Anonymous** user.
5. Review permissions of **newly registered/default users**
6. Disable anonymous access if not strictly necessary
7. Review exposed **published REST services** and **microflows** for authorization enforcement
8. Consider upgrading to supported Mendix versions (for example 10 LTS / 11 MTS, where applicable in your environment)
9. Perform a security review and/or pentest focused on authorization and data exposure

##### If sensitive data is accessible:

- restrict access immediately
- review available logging for signs of misuse
- assess whether a data breach notification is required

[Menscan.io](Menscan.io) and [MendixHunter](https://github.com/Jelle-DIVD/MendixHunter) can help map your Mendix exposure and identify internet-facing instances that may require authorization review.

### Notes from Mendix

Mendix has indicated that this is **not** a platform vulnerability, but a configuration and development responsibility for application owners.

### Collaboration

During pentests, manual reviews, and large-scale public-source inventory, we repeatedly found Mendix apps exposing data to users who should not have access.

The research started with Rudy Dijkstra’s **menscan.io**, after which DIVD formed a researcher group to confirm this was a structural issue across many organizations, supported by multiple DIVD researchers (including contributors affiliated with SUPERP-MxBlue).
