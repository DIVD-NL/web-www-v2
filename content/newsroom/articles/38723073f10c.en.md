        - description: "It's great that you're skeptical. However, **this is legit and definitely not a scam.** This operation is a collaboration between the Dutch National Police, Europol, Digital Trust Center, NCSC and others. We, Dutch Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), are mentioned in the press releases from the Dutch Police and Europol. The 'Check je Hack. (translation: Check your Hack) FAQ also mentiones DIVD and shares a link back to this casefile."
          title: Is this a scam?
        - title: Do you have my password?
          description: No, we do not have your password. We may have sent you an email containing a partial password, with only the last four characters visible. This is the only part of your password we possess because the Dutch Police ensured that all passwords were hidden before sharing the data with us.
        - title: You are processing my personal data without my consent, is that legal?
          description: Yes it is. Under Dutch law and European privacy regulations, we can process this data based on a so-called "legitimate interest." DIVD is a private foundation that operates under a strict code of conduct, with the aim to make the digital world safer.
