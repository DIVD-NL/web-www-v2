  With the support of the Dutch embassy in Tokyo, I (Chris van 't Hof) have researched Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) in Japan. I had the opportunity to travel to Japan from October 22 to November 22. 

  During my stay, I interviewed security researchers from various governmental institutes, companies, and universities and spoke with hackers, most of whom were foreign nationals residing in Japan. I also participated in conferences and meetings: KEIO Cybersecurity Conference (30-10/1-11), Cyber Risk Meetup (1-11), TengueSec meetup (13-11), CodeBlue (14-11/15-11), and AVTokyo (16-11). One of the highlights of my trip was organizing a CVD expert meeting with the Dutch embassy on the 13th of November. The last days I spent in the beautiful coastal village of Kamakura to start writing this report.
