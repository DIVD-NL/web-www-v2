      - title: Why did I receive an email of DIVD / CSIRT?
        description: >-
          If we find a vulnerability, we'll set up a case with all the details
          we know and how to patch this vulnerability. Then we scan known IP
          adresses to see if they're vulernable and if that's the case we'll
          send out an email to every vulnerable IP adress. 


          O﻿ur emails are personally written by one of our researchers and contain a link to the casefile on the [csirt.divd.nl ](csirt.divd.nl)site.

          prioritize the vulnerabilities we work on by various metrics, for
          instance how big the exposure on the internet is and if it is being
          actively abused or not.
        title: What type of vulnerabilities do you notify?
      - title: Do you prevent scanning IP addresses of big (foreign) companies to avoid
          lawsuits or any legal issues?
        description: No. We scan everyone who runs the targeted software throughout  the
          whole IPv4 range. Only after a hit, we see who it is.
      - description: Most of our volunteers work in cyber security and will stay
          up-to-date on what is going on. We take information from various feeds
          / mailing lists / news sources.
