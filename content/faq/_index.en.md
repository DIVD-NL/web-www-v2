      - title: Why did I receive an email of DIVD / CSIRT?
        description: >-
          If we find a vulnerability, we'll set up a case with all the details
          we know and how to patch this vulnerability. Then we scan known IP
          adresses to see if they're vulernable and if that's the case we'll
          send out an email to every vulnerable IP adress. 


          O﻿ur emails are personally written by one of our researchers and contain a link to the casefile on the [csirt.divd.nl ](csirt.divd.nl)site.
