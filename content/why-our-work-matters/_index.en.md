opener: DIVD's work is of great importance
intro: >-
  Working for DIVD, we aim to make the digital world safer by reporting
  vulnerabilities we find in digital systems to the people who can mitigate
  them. 


  But what are exactly are (zero-day) vulnerabilities, and why is it so important to find them as soon as possible? Find these (and other) frequently used cyber security definitions on this page.

    ### **What exactly is a security vulnerability?**


    According to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a vulnerability is a ‚Äúweakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.‚Äù


    Essentially, a security vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a computer system, network, or software that can be exploited by cyber attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. Examples of vulnerabilities can be software bugs, or systems that lack the latest security updates. Think of it like a crack in the foundation of a house: if left unfixed, it can be a way for intruders to get inside. 


    If an organisation doesn't address vulnerabilities, the consequences can be severe, ranging from financial losses to irreparable damage to its reputation. 


    Resolving vulnerabilities is typically a matter of ensuring bug-free code and keeping systems updated with the most recent security patches. Despite the apparent simplicity of these solutions, a significant number of organisations remain vulnerable. What could be the reason for this?

    ### **Introducing; the zero-day vulnerability (or 0-day)**


    Ideally, a discovered vulnerability is directly reported to the vendor. The vendor rewards the finder (often via a bug bounty program) and agrees with the finder to keep the software vulnerability a secret. The vendor then creates a patch and (periodically) releases updates containing one or more security patches. Thus, the vendor is aware of the issue and provides a fix. 


    However, sometimes a ‚Äúzero-day vulnerability‚Äù occurs. A zero-day vulnerability is a specific type of security flaw that is unknown to the software developers or the wider security community at the time it is discovered by hackers. Because the vulnerability is not yet known, no one can properly protect against it. Returning to the house analogy, imagine advertising on the internet that you‚Äôve left your front door open while you‚Äôre away for the weekend.


    ü§ì *The term ‚Äòzero-day‚Äô reflects that the developers had zero days to develop a fix.*

### DIVD‚Äôs efforts are invaluable to society for several reasons

First of all, DIVD scans for both known √°nd zero-day vulnerabilities. When vulnerable URLs or systems are detected, we send the owners of the website or system a notification email. 

Furthermore, DIVD is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), which means that when we identify new (previously unknown) vulnerabilities we can request the assignment of unique identifiers (CVEs). 

Besides all this effort, DIVD complements the work of other CSIRTs by focusing on proactive vulnerability disclosure and awareness. This approach helps in preventing cyber attacks and contributes to a safer digital world. 

In summary, DIVD plays a crucial role in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats, protecting both individuals and organizations from potential harm. By raising awareness about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and weaknesses, DIVD helps educate the public and businesses on how to protect themselves online.
