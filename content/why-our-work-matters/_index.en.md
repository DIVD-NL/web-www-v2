title: DIVD's work is of great importance, here is why
intro: >-
  Working for DIVD, we aim to make the digital world safer by reporting
  vulnerabilities we find in digital systems to the people who can mitigate
  them. 


  But what are exactly are (zero-day) vulnerabilities, and why is it so important to find them as soon as possible? Find these (and other) frequently used cyber security definitions on this page.

    ## **Security Vulnerability**


    According to [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability#:~:text=Definitions%3A,triggered%20by%20a%20threat%20source.) (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a vulnerability is a ‚Äúw*eakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.*‚Äù


    Essentially, a security vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a computer system, network, or software that can be exploited by cyber attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. Examples of vulnerabilities can be software bugs, or systems that lack the latest security updates. 


    Let‚Äôs compare a system vulnerability to a misplaced or broken lock, using the analogy of a house. Inside your house, you keep your valuable belongings and sensitive secrets. If there‚Äôs a hole in the wall or the doors are accidentally left unlocked, it provides an opportunity for intruders to get inside.


    If an organisation doesn't find and mitigate vulnerabilities, the consequences can be severe, ranging from financial losses to irreparable damage to its reputation.

    ## **Zero-day Vulnerability**


    Ideally, a discovered vulnerability is directly reported to the vendor. The vendor rewards the finder (often via a bug bounty program) and agrees with the finder to keep the software vulnerability a secret. The vendor then creates a patch and (periodically) releases updates containing one or more security patches. Thus, the vendor is aware of the issue and provides a fix. 


    However, sometimes a ‚Äúzero-day vulnerability‚Äù occurs. A zero-day (0-day) vulnerability is a specific type of security flaw that is unknown to the software developers or the wider security community at the time it is discovered by hackers. Because the vulnerability is not yet known, no one can properly protect against it. 


    Returning to the house analogy, imagine advertising on the internet that you‚Äôve left your front door open while you‚Äôre away for the weekend.


    ü§ì *The term ‚Äòzero-day‚Äô reflects that the developers had zero days to develop a fix.*


    ü§ì *Eternal Blue is a very infamous zero-day exploit that was originally was developed by the NSA and later leaked by a hacking group. It was used in the [WannaCry ransomware attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack), which affected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.*

  **Availability**\

  At DIVD, we adhere to the ‚ÄòPrinciple of Proportionality‚Äô and the ‚ÄòPrinciple of Subsidiarity‚Äô, as described in our Code of Conduct. This means that our research should increase and not decrease the integrity and availability of any and all online systems. If several means are available to meet the need, we opt for the one which has the least impact on the availability of the systems and services.


  **Case**\

  When DIVD talks about a ‚Äúcase‚Äù we refer to a record or file created to document and manage the process of addressing a specific vulnerability. It typically includes details such as:


  * Description of the Vulnerability: Information about the nature and specifics of the vulnerability.

  * Fingerprint Creation: A unique identifier or signature for the vulnerability to help in identifying affected systems.

  * Scanning and Identification: The process of scanning systems to find instances that are vulnerable.

  * Notification: Informing the owners of the vulnerable systems about the issue so they can take corrective action.

  * This structured approach helps ensure that vulnerabilities are tracked, managed, and resolved systematically.


  **Confidentiality**\

  At DIVD, we work with sensitive data every day. Think about lists of IP addresses, types of vulnerabilities found, contact information, and metadata (e.g. timestamps, scripts, researchers working on the data). The members of DIVD take all precautions necessary to protect the confidentiality of this data.


  **(Ethical) Hacker / White Hat Hacker**\

  DIVD members belong to the ‚Äúwhite hat‚Äù hackers. A white hat hacker is someone who breaks into a computer system with positive intentions. The aim is to detect security breaches. The term ‚Äòwhite hat‚Äô comes from cowboy movies in which the hero always wore a white hat. A whitehat hacker is also called an ethical hacker. Our members are skilled professionals that must always operate within legal boundaries. Please read our code of conduct for more information. 


  **Exploit**\

  An exploit is a malicious application or script that can be used to take advantage of a system's vulnerability. At DIVD, we don‚Äôt use or run intrusive exploits to verify the existence of a vulnerability in a system. Destructive commands like ‚Äú$ rm -rf /‚Äù or testing for denial of service are not permitted in any scenario. If several means are available to meet the need, we opt for the one which has the least impact on the availability of the systems and services.


  **Responsible disclosure**\

  In cybersecurity, responsible disclosure refers to the procedure where a security analyst, ethical hacker, or ethical hacker organisation such as DIVD notifies an organisation about a detected vulnerability in its systems or software. This notification is done in such a way that the organisation has the opportunity to mitigate the weakness before it becomes public knowledge and possibly misused by hackers with malicious intentions. By privately notifying organisations, they can address the vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious hackers, thereby improving the security of their systems.


  Responsible disclosure helps protect users, maintains trust between (DIVD) researchers and organisations, and contributes to the ongoing improvement of cybersecurity practices.


  **Security.txt**\

  Security.txt is a proposed standard for websites to provide a clear and consistent way for security researchers to report security vulnerabilities. It involves placing a simple text file named security.txt in the well-known location /.well-known/ directory of a website (e.g., https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt). This file contains contact information and other details that guide researchers on how to responsibly disclose security issues to the organization. 


  **Types of vulnerabilities**\

  There are different types of vulnerabilities. Since DIVD scans IP addresses over the public internet, we mainly focus on web-based vulnerabilities. A good example of a database filled with web-based vulnerabilities is The OWASP Top 10.


  **Vulnerability versus exploit**\

  A vulnerability is an issue or weakness in a system or application, whereas an exploit is an active component used to carry out an attack. The purpose of an exploit is to ‚Äòexploit‚Äô a vulnerability. A vulnerability itself does not cause harm by itself but creates an opportunity for an attacker to exploit it.

‚ú® First of all, DIVD scans for both known √°nd zero-day vulnerabilities. When vulnerable URLs or systems are detected, we send the owners of the website or system a notification email. 

‚ú® Furthermore, DIVD is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), which means that when we identify new (previously unknown) vulnerabilities we can request the assignment of unique identifiers (CVEs). 

‚ú® Besides all this effort, DIVD complements the work of other CSIRTs by focusing on proactive vulnerability disclosure and awareness. This approach helps in preventing cyber attacks and contributes to a safer digital world. 

‚ú® In summary, DIVD plays a crucial role in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats, protecting both individuals and organizations from potential harm. By raising awareness about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and weaknesses, DIVD helps educate the public and businesses on how to protect themselves online.
