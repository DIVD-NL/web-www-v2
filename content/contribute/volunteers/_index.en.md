  - title: Ethical Integrity
    description: Volunteers must demonstrate a strong commitment to ethical conduct
      in their work. They should prioritise the well-being and safety of
      internet users and respect privacy and legal boundaries while conducting
      vulnerability research.
  - title: Societal Responsibility
    description: Volunteers should be driven by a sense of societal responsibility,
      understanding the importance of their role in making the digital world
      safer. They should be motivated by the greater good rather than personal
      gain, political agendas, or individual interests.
  - title: Collaborative Mindset
    description: Volunteers should value collaboration and teamwork. They should be
      willing to work with diverse stakeholders, including vendors, researchers,
      and trusted partners, to coordinate vulnerability disclosure and mitigate
      risks effectively. Effective communication and cooperation are key to the
      success of DIVD's mission.
  - title: Technical Proficiency
    description: Volunteers should possess a solid understanding of cybersecurity
      principles and techniques. If joining one of our technical teams, they
      should have the technical skills necessary to identify and analyse
      vulnerabilities in online systems effectively. Continuous learning and
      staying updated with evolving technologies and threats are essential.
