    description: >-
      The CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is the beating heart
      of DIVD, responsible for scanning the Internet and notifying system owners
      of the vulnerabilities found in their systems. Within the CSIRT, the team
      of CNA Administrators is responsible for DIVD's role as CVE Number
      Authority (NA). They can independently assign CVE numbers and update CVE
      records for vulnerabilities within our scope.

  - title: Research & Development
    description: >-
      DIVD has two teams of highly skilled security researchers who voluntarily
      seek out and report vulnerabilities alongside their regular jobs. DIVD
      ensures they adhere to our Code of Conduct while providing a buffer
      against journalists, lawyers, and recruiters. Their research not only
      uncovers security trends and raises awareness but also helps develop new
      methods for vulnerability research and disclosure. Although you may never
      meet our researchers, you can hope they are inspecting your systems right
      now, catching issues before the bad guys do....

      A safe working environment

      DIVD continuously strives  to be a safe and healthy organization, where
      everyone feels at home. Creating a workplace where individuals feel
      secure, included, valued, trusted and respected is crucial for fostering a
      positive and productive atmosphere. Maintaining such an environment is
      essential for the well-being and professional development of our
      workforce. Therefore DIVD has appointed confidential advisors, by which we
      aim to provide employees with a dedicated and trustworthy channel to
      address concerns related to unwanted behaviors or integrity violations.


      Unwanted behaviors, such as exclusion, bullying, harassment,
      discrimination, and aggression, can have a detrimental impact on an
      individual's well-being and the overall workplace environment. Similarly,
      integrity violations, encompassing actions like corruption, fraud, abuse
      of power, and disclosure of sensitive information, compromise the ethical
      foundation of an organization. DIVD acknowledges the severity of these
      issues and takes a proactive stance by not tolerating such behaviors.


      The presence of the confidential advisors underscores the importance of
      open communication, addressing issues promptly, and upholding ethical
      standards. By offering this support system, DIVD aims to ensure that
      employees feel heard, supported, and empowered to address concerns without
      fear of reprisal. Also, DIVD intends to strengthen the trusted
      relationship, reassure employees that their concerns are taken seriously,
      and demonstrate its commitment to maintaining a workplace where integrity
      is paramount.
