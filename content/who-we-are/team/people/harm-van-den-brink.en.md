I'm an expert in IT and cybersecurity, with a strong background in IT technology, the electric mobility infrastructure and the energy sector. I'm skilled in coming up with new ideas, particularly in areas like electric cars, (online) security, and managing energy.

When it comes to cybersecurity I like the technology about protecting networks, testing security, coding, and handling security breaches. Lately I've been looking more and more into legislation, and the lack of it, when it comes to cyber security and the electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
