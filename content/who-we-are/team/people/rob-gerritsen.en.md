role: COO
intro: >-
  With over a decade of experience in the cybersecurity domain, I have
  established a solid reputation for expertise in strategic planning, risk
  management, and incident response. Currently serving as the Chief Operating
  Officer at DIVD, I lead initiatives aimed at improving business operations and
  risk management.


  Simultaneously, I hold the position of Chief Information Security Officer at
  both Graafschap College and Gemeente Doetinchem, where I am responsible for
  developing comprehensive security frameworks to safeguard sensitive
  information and uphold compliance standards. My tenure as Continuity Manager
  at Gemeente Doetinchem further underscores my proficiency in ensuring business
  continuity and disaster recovery measures.


  I firmly believe that information security is not just the responsibility of
  cybersecurity professionals but of every employee, manager, and executive in
  the organization. By empowering individuals as the first line of defense
  through providing them with tools, knowledge, and support, alongside technical
  and organizational measures, we collectively elevate our information security
  standards.


  On a personal level, I am characterized as analytical, curious, structured,
  and solution-oriented. My passion lies in staying abreast of developments in
  information security, cybersecurity, cybercrime, and behavior influence.
  Through continuous self-reflection and a commitment to growth, I strive to
  bring out the best in myself, firmly believing that standing still is akin to
  moving backward.
