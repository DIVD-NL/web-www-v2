Joined DIVD in 2023 as researcher, now helping at CSIRT. 

I have extensive experience in managing teams and businesses and am accustomed to maintaining an overview. After a bootcamp in Ethical Hacking at Novi University of Applied Sciences, I also finished my CISSP  certification. Working as a Cyber Security Consultant.
