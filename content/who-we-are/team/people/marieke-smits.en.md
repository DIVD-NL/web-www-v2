Joined DIVD in 2021 and started with the biggest communication project so far: the new website. Also organised fun DIVD parties, the DIVD partnerevent and will continue to make DIVD understandable for non-hackers. 

I work as a communication & marketing specialist at PuraSec, a Cybersecurity Company in Delft and joined the Projectlead team of WHY2025 (the Dutch hackercamp, also known as MCH / SHA). Also known as Piiindakaas.
