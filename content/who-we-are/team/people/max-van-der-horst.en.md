Cybersecurity is an endless race between attackers and defenders. This endlessness can work tiring for a lot of people in the industry. What makes DIVD amazing is the fact that we are inbetween these attackers and defenders. We attempt to take away attacker's weapons as quickly as possible by making people aware of these weapons. That has a lot of impact! I came to participate in the perpetual defender's puzzle and stayed for the way we assist organizations by spreading puzzle pieces across the entire globe.
