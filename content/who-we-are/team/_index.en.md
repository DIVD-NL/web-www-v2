      DIVD has two teams highly skilled security researchers who seek and report
      vulnerabilities as a voluntary service next to their jobs. DIVD sees to it
      they follow our Code of Conduct while we provide them a firewall for
      journalists, lawyers and recruiters. Meanwhile, their research also serves
      as an empirical base to discover trends in security, stimulate security
      awareness and develop new methodologies in vulnerability research and
      disclosure. So, although you will probably never meet our researchers, you
      may hope they are checking your systems right now, before the bad guys do…
