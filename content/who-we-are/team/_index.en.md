opener: Meet our Team
intro: We're very thankful and proud of all our team members, who spend their
  free time to a good cause, voluntarily. The people who work with us are very
  various people, some have just started their career in cybersecurity and
  others have worked in cybersecurity for a very long time. Due to privacy
  reasons, which we can only encourage, not every member has a profile picture
  or is mentioned in a team.

    description: DIVD has two teams highly skilled security researchers who seek and
      report vulnerabilities as a voluntary service next to their jobs. DIVD
      sees to it they follow our Code of Conduct while we provide them a
      firewall for journalists, lawyers and recruiters. Meanwhile, their
      research also serves as an empirical base to discover trends in security,
      stimulate security awareness and develop new methodologies in
      vulnerability research and disclosure. So, although you will probably
      never meet our researchers, you may hope they are checking your systems
      right now, before the bad guys do…
