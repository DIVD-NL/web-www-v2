opener: Meet our Team
intro: We're very thankful and proud of all our team members, who spend their
  free time to a good cause, voluntarily. The people who work with us are very
  various people, some have just started their career in cybersecurity and
  others have worked in cybersecurity for a very long time. Due to privacy
  reasons, which we can only encourage, not every member has a profile picture
  or is mentioned in a team.

    description: DIVD has two teams highly skilled security researchers who seek and
      report vulnerabilities as a voluntary service next to their jobs. DIVD
      sees to it they follow our Code of Conduct while we provide them a
      firewall for journalists, lawyers and recruiters. Meanwhile, their
      research also serves as an empirical base to discover trends in security,
      stimulate security awareness and develop new methodologies in
      vulnerability research and disclosure. So, although you will probably
      never meet our researchers, you may hope they are checking your systems
      right now, before the bad guys do…

    description: >-
      DIVD continuously strives to be a safe and healthy organization, where
      everyone feels at home. Creating a workplace where individuals feel
      secure, included, valued, trusted and respected is crucial for fostering a
      positive and productive atmosphere. Maintaining such an environment is
      essential for the well-being and professional development of our
      workforce. Therefore DIVD has appointed confidential advisors, by which we
      aim to provide employees with a dedicated and trustworthy channel to
      address concerns related to unwanted behaviors or integrity violations.



      Unwanted behaviors, such as exclusion, bullying, harassment, discrimination, and aggression, can have a detrimental impact on an individual’s well-being and the overall workplace environment. Similarly, integrity violations, encompassing actions like corruption, fraud, abuse of power, and disclosure of sensitive information, compromise the ethical foundation of an organization. DIVD acknowledges the severity of these issues and takes a proactive stance by not tolerating such behaviors.



      The presence of the confidential advisors underscores the importance of open communication, addressing issues promptly, and upholding ethical standards. By offering this support system, DIVD aims to ensure that employees feel heard, supported, and empowered to address concerns without fear of reprisal. Also, DIVD intends to strengthen the trusted relationship, reassure employees that their concerns are taken seriously, and demonstrate its commitment to maintaining a workplace where integrity is paramount.
