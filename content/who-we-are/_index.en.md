  title: Mission & History
  intro: "This wonderful adventure started with the work of hacker Victor Gevers,
    who was already scanning and notifying the whole world for 20 years.
    Together with Parliamentarian cybermum Astrid Oosenbrug, writer/researcher
    and talk show host Chris van â€˜t Hof, he went to the notary and registered
    DIVD as a foundation on 26 September 2019. After the launch CISO/hacker
    Frank Breedijk and Security Analyst Lennaert Oudshoorn joined and started
    the first case in January 2020: Citrix, notifying 546 potential victims in
    the Netherlands. "

    Citrix, notifying 546 potential victims in the Netherlands. After this first
    media exposure many hackers and partners joined. Together they drew up a
    Code of Conduct to comply with the rules of vulnerability disclosure. In
    that year, 13 more cases followed, notifying 58K potential victims
    worldwide. "
