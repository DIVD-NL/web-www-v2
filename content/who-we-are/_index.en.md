opener: We are the safe-keepers of the digital world
intro: Five years ago, a few enthusiastic ethical hackers founded the Dutch Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) to make the digital world safer. Today, our team has grown to over 161 dedicated and skilled individuals, all working together towards the same mission.

  title: History
  intro: "This wonderful adventure started with the work of hacker Victor Gevers, who was already scanning and notifying the whole world for 20 years. Together with Parliamentarian cybermum Astrid Oosenbrug, writer/researcher and talk show host Chris van â€˜t Hof, he registered Dutch Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) as a foundation on 26 September 2019."
  description: "After the launch CISO/hacker Frank Breedijk and Security Analyst Lennaert Oudshoorn joined and started the first case in January 2020: Citrix, notifying 546 potential victims in the Netherlands. After this first media exposure many hackers and partners joined. Together they drew up a Code of Conduct to comply with the rules of vulnerability disclosure. In that year, 13 more cases followed, notifying 58K potential victims worldwide."

  description: Cybersecurity is an endless race between attackers and defenders. This endlessness can work tiring for a lot of people in the industry. What makes DIVD amazing is the fact that we are in between these attackers and defenders. We attempt to take away attackers' weapons as quickly as possible by making people aware of these weapons. That has a lot of impact! I came to participate in the perpetual defender's puzzle and stayed for the way we assist organizations by spreading puzzle pieces across the entire globe.
