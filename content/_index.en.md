  title: Security.txt. Small effort, big effect!
  description: Simplify our work by adding our security.txt file to your website's
    code and including our IP range (194.5.73.0-255) on your allow list. This
    will enable our research team to search for vulnerabilities without setting
    off your cybersecurity systems. It will also provide us with the correct
    contact information when we discover vulnerabilities. The implementation is
    straightforward, requiring only the creation and publication of a text file
    on the server. See securitytxt.org for more information.
