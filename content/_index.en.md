    Make our work easier by putting our security.txt in the code of
          your website and our IP 194.5.73.0-255 on your allow list. This way you
          make sure that our research team can look for vulnerabilities without
          alarming your cyber security systems. And we know who to talk to when we
          find vulnerabilities.
