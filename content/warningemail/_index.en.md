title: Notification emails
opener: We report vulnerabilities to prevent issues
intro: >-
  Whenever a vulnerability is found, we open a case and create a fingerprint*.
  Afterwards, we start scanning to identify vulnerable instances and notify the
  owners of these systems. This structured approach helps ensure that
  vulnerabilities are tracked, managed, and resolved systematically.


  A case is a record or file, created to document and manage the process of addressing the specific vulnerability.  A fingerprint is a unique identifier or signature for the vulnerability to help in identifying affected systems.

    CSIRT: Computer Security Incident Response Team


    The CSIRT handles the scanning for and disclosing of vulnerabilities, either discovered by DIVD researchers or third parties and warning people for leaked credentials and operates our CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) capability.


    **Only owners of vulnerable instances receive a notification with the host information and mitigation steps.**

    If you've received an notification (email) from our CSIRT, check whether the
    email address contains @divd.nl. This could be csirt@divd.nl,
    divd-case-number@csirt.divd.nl or a name-of-researcher@divd.nl (as some of
    our researchers prefer to send notifications from their personal DIVD
    account).
