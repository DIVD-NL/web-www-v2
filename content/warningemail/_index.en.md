  description: >-
    Our CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) takes care of DIVD's
    vulnerability disclosure process. These vulnerabilities may be discovered by
    our own DIVD researchers, or come from signals from third parties. CSIRT
    initiates scanning for vulnerabilities, and reporting vulnerable systems to
    their respective owners. CSIRT also operates DIVD's CVE Numbering Authority
    (CNA).


    **Only owners of vulnerable instances receive a notification with the host information and mitigation steps.**
